Outscal DSA Mat2 project

<b>About the game:</b>
</br>
In this project I have created 7 X 7 table. (Row and columns are marked properly.)</br>
There will be 4 bombs. These values can be changed but in this project I kept it fix. </br>
So after the game is started. you can see the rule . This is the classic mine sweeper game.</br>
Start playing by entering values from 0-6. Input validation is there. So if you enter anything else that will not be accepted.</br>
